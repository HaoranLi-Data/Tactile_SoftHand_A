Summary: This video is used as the supplment material that shows the design and performance evaluation experiments in this paper.

1. In section 1, we compared the gestures of different type fingers. Then we test the D-type and A-type finger adaptibility. 

2. In section 2, we show the design of fully 3D-printed tactile fingertip, also its demo related to tactile sensing.

3. In section 3, we show the exploded animation of Tactile SoftHand-A which can show its sturcture intutively. 

4. In section 4, we show the experiment B video - the controllable grasping gestures.

5. In section 5, we show the experiment C video - the grasping adaptability.

6. In section 6, we show the experiment D video - tactile feedback control.
