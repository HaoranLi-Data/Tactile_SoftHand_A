Open-sourced CAD Model of Tactile SoftHand-A, and its fabricating instruction.

CAD Model: 
1. ‘softfinger with tactile fingertip.stp‘ is the assembled robotic finger with tctile fingertip.
2. ‘softfinger without tactile fingertip.stp‘ is the assembled robotic finger without tctile fingertip but general fingertip.
3. ’SoftHand with Active Antagonism.stp‘ is the assembled whole robotic hand file.
4. 'Tactile_fingertip_for_3D_Printing.stp' is the file of tactile fingertip for 3D printing.
